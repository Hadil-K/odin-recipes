# Odin Recipes

This is a simple recipe website I’m building as part of my journey revisiting the basics through The Odin Project.

# About

I’m using this project to brush up on front-end fundamentals — mainly HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
It starts with the basic HTML structure, and I’ll be gradually adding styling and functionality as I go.

# Goals

Write clean, semantic HTML

Style the site in a way that looks good and works across different devices

Add some interactivity using JavaScript (once the basics are done)

# What’s Included (so far)

A homepage that links to individual recipes

Recipe pages with structured HTML content

CSS for layout and design (in progress)

JavaScript to make things a bit more dynamic (coming soon)

# What I’m Practicing

Organizing HTML clearly and semantically

Writing modular, maintainable CSS

Adding JS features without breaking the base experience

# Current Status

Still in progress — HTML is mostly done, and I’m starting to work on the styling and interactivity next.

# Preview

Coming soon.

#Live Demo

Not live yet — will be once everything’s in better shape.
